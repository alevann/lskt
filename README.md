# lskt

Wanted to do something in C, I don't use it often so it kinda sucks probably.<br>
I can't really tell when C code sucks.

Anyhow this program works kinda like the command `ls` but it's cooler, cause I made it. Also it's somewhat similar to `tree` as well from what I've seen, but I never really used it so...

Does not support unicode file names (maybe, who knows, haven't tested it).


## Build

On unix systems just build `main.c` into an executable program and you're set.

On windows you can give up now.
